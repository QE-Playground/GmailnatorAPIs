# VincentAutoGmailnator
API calls for gmailnator using okHttp3 and testng.

This public version does not come with all features which I have developed, namely an extension of AssertJ soft assertion which can provide steps in extent report, and work around when we have multiple TestNG test clases.

How to run gmailnator REST calls: 

1. Cloning the project by IntelliJ. IntelliJ IDEA Community Edition 2020 is highly recommended.
2. Import project as Maven project.


Updated 2021-01-20: I integrated the first chain of REST calls with Extent Report.
